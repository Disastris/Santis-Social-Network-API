# Santis-Social-Network-API

## Description

My motivation for this project is to better my understanding of mongoDB and trying to perfect my work in back end data retrieving. By building this application I learned how to make a Social Network API and how to add users, thoughts and reactions for each post!

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Installation

To install this application, you first pull it into your local computer. Then you would run the command, "npm run seed" to seed the data needed for the database. Then you would run the command in your terminal, "npm run start" to get the application to start.

## Usage

From there you will go into your insomnia and be able to add, delete, update, and find all the users, thoughts and reactions. You would use the GET command up top to get all the users in the database. The PUT command to update any existing users. The DELETE command to delete any users. And the POST command to create a new user
